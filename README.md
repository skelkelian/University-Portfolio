## CPSC 131 - Data Structures
### Homework Assignments
In this course I learned fundamental data structures and algorithms. These data structures include arrays, vectors, stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, heaps, hash tables, and graphs. Some of the algorithms discussed were searching, sorting, traversing, and hashing. Homework in this class was a collection of "mini projects" that build on top of one another introducing new concepts as the course progressed.

## EGME 497 - Undergraduate Study
### Tensor Transformation Visualization
From Summer 2021-2022, I developed a web-based application using Unity Game Engine that illustrates three-dimensional stress transformations dynamically, in real time. The development on this application was supervised by my professor Dr. Sanders. Prior to starting development, neither my professor or myself had experience using Unity game engine or writing in C#. I learned how to use Unity Game Engine through online tutorials and videos and successfully published the [web application](https://jdubulew.github.io/tensor-transform-visualization/) through GitHub Pages alongside its paper, [Visualizing tensor component transformations using virtual reality and web-based applications](https://github.com/skelkelian/University-Portfolio/blob/main/EGME%20497%20-%20Undergraduate%20Study/visualizing-tensor-component-transformations-using-virtual-reality-and-web-based-applications.pdf) published at the ASEE Conference in August 2022.

## CPSC 120 - Introduction to Programming
### Labs
In this course I learned the basics of programming in C++. This includes the design and execution of programs; sequential nature of programs; use of assignment, control and input/output statements to accomplish desired tasks; design and use of functions. Homework in this class was in the form of "labs" which are located in the [Labs folder](https://github.com/skelkelian/University-Portfolio/tree/main/CPSC%20120%20-%20Introduction%20to%20Programming).

### Final Project
In the final project, we were tasked with coding a text-based game. I decided to code a text-based Maze game which allowed the player to select between mazes of various size. The code for this project is located in the [Final Project - Maze folder](https://github.com/skelkelian/University-Portfolio/tree/main/CPSC%20120%20-%20Introduction%20to%20Programming/Final%20Project%20-%20Maze).

## EGME 308 - Engineering Analysis
### Checkpoints
This was a semester long, project-based course about fundamentals and engineering applications of Fourier transforms, Laplace transforms, complex analysis, and vector analysis. The project was split into four checkpoints, with the fourth being a presentation. For each checkpoint, we wrote a report using Latex which explained our thought process and detailed work. We were tasked to design a telescopic antenna that would serve as an (FM) signal receiver for portable radios. This task requires a specific design geometry which includes: number of sections, length, and thickness. All of which must meet the given design requirements as well as successfully pick up FM radio signals. At the end of the semester, my group won both the best design meaning it was the lightest along with being the least expensive design to satisfy the design requirements.

## EGME 205 - Digital Computation
The first computer science related course I took was Digital Computation. In this course, I learned the programming language [MATLAB](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjk2MSe5qz9AhVqiO4BHQIvBsUQFnoECBkQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mathworks.com%2Fproducts%2Fmatlab.html&usg=AOvVaw2I52UaBehIzd-SXxzguL5I) which is a matrix-based programming language allowing the most natural expression of computational mathematics. This course served as my first introduction to Computer Science concepts. I learned about fundamental concepts in programming such as variables and loops, how to write and call functions, and wrote scripts to calculate common Engineering problems.

### Final Project: Battleship
In the final project, I was tasked with coding the text-based game, Battleship with three different difficulties. This was a great project for me to apply the concepts I learned in the course. The code for this project is located in the [Battleship Project](https://github.com/skelkelian/University-Portfolio/tree/main/EGME%20205%20-%20Digital%20Computation/Battleship%20Project) folder.
